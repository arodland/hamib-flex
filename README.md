<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
We absolutely love our Flex radios! We just wish we had a Linux-native way to work with them so that Windows or Maestro isn't required.

nCAT enables you to present a hamlib interface to your Flex radio so that any hamlib-aware application can use it.

### Built With
* [Go](https://golang.org)

## Getting Started

### Connecting to an Existing GUI

If you have a Maestro, an "M" model radio, or a copy of SmartSDR or another GUI running somewhere, and you want nCAT to control (and be controlled by) that session, find that client's "station" name, and run

```
./nCAT -station Whatever
```

This mode will be familiar to those who have used CAT for Windows.

### Headless mode

If you would like to create a new "headless" session, independent of any GUI client, run

```
$ ./nCAT -headless
```

Headless mode connects to the radio as a "GUI client", which means that it has its own slices and panadapters (even if you can't really see them), and counts towards the limit of 2 clients per radio.

In either case, a hamlib net protocol (rigctld) server will start on TCP port 4532.

### Installation
1. Download the latest binary using the Releases icon above or [Releases](https://github.com/kc2g-flex-tools/nCAT/releases)
2. Make it executible: `chmod +x nCAT`

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
```
$ ./nCAT -h
Usage of ./nCAT:
  -headless
        run in headless mode
  -listen string
        hamlib listen [address]:port (default ":4532")
  -profile string
        global profile to load on startup for -headless mode
  -radio string
        radio IP address or discovery spec (default ":discover:")
  -slice string
        slice letter to control (default "A")
  -station string
        station name to bind to or create (default "Flex")
```
### Multiple Instances
To run multiple nCAT instances, see `scripts/multislice_startup.sh`.

### Using with WSJT-X

To setup WSJT-X with nCAT and hamlib, use the following settings:
